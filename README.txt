This is a simple application to test out the DayLife (http://daylife.com) API with Django. The intention is to add users who have personalized news topics they wish to follow and to serve up a page with the latest news for them.

The DayLifeAPI module is one of my github repos. It is based on the python code sample at daylife.com.

For now, the CSS headers are from daylife.com. I'll likely change that soon to give it a more original style.
